# 2. Project Architecture
PeerPrep is implemented using a Microservices Architecture to ensure scalability and separation of concerns.
| Service | Role | Tech Stack | Port |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| API Gateway (Nginx) | Routing and Load Balancing | Nginx | 80 |
| User Service | Authentication and User Profiles Management | Node/Express, MongoDB | 4001 |
| Question Service | Question Repository and Fetching | Node/Express, MongoDB | 4002 |
| Matching Service | Queueing, Matchmaking, SSE/WebSockets | Node/Express, Redis | 4003 |
| Collaboration Service | Real-time Code Editing and Chatting | Node/Socket.io, Redis | 4004 |

# 3. Pre-requisites
You must have the following installed to run the project locally:
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (Required for all services and databases)
- `node 22.19.0 (LTS)`
- `pnpm` (Recommended package manager for monorepo workspaces)

# 4. Installation and Setup
## 4.1 Clone Repository and Install Dependencies for Frontend and Backend
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CS3219-AY2526Sem1/cs3219-ay2526s1-project-g05.git peerprep
cd peerprep

# Install pnpm dependencies across all microservices
cd frontend && pnpm install && cd -
cd backend && pnpm -r install && cp .env.example .env && cd -
```

## 4.2 Setup Docker Containers
This command will set up the foundational database containers (MongoDB and Redis).
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-local.yml up -d
```
- This sets up only MongoDB, for now
